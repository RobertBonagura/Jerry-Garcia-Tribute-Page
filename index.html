           <p>"You need music. I don't know why. It's probably one of those Joseph Campbell questions, why we need ritual. We need magic and bliss, and power and myth and celebration and religion in our lives and music is a good way to encapsulate a lot of it." - Jerry Garcia""</p>

           <p id="quote">There's no way to measure his greatness or magnitude as a person or a player. I don;t think any eulogizing will do him justice. He really had no equal. To me, he wasn't only a musician and friend, he was more like a big brother who taught and showed me more than he'll ever know." - Bob Dylan</p>
